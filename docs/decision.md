# Decisions and reasoning

Why RuseTect is built the way it is, and why each change in the November 2026 review session was made. Numbers come
from the files named next to them.

## Architecture

**Rust for serving, Python for training.**
Serving touches every payment, so it needs predictable latency, one small binary and no garbage-collector pauses: Rust
gives all three and runs unchanged on a laptop, in Docker and on Vercel. Training happens offline and needs the mature
gradient-boosting libraries (XGBoost, LightGBM, scikit-learn), whose cores are already compiled C++. Rewriting training
in Rust would cost days and risk the parity we verify (Rust matches Python to within 3e-8). The rule: anything that runs
per payment is Rust; anything that fits a model is Python, and the Rust engine loads the exported model files.

**Gradient-boosted trees, not a neural network.**
Payment data is tabular, the positives are rare (0.1% to 2%), and analysts need reasons. Trees are the strongest
published baseline on this kind of data, train in minutes on a CPU, and give exact per-feature explanations
(TreeSHAP). The research review found no evidence that a graph neural network beats trees with graph features on
these datasets (`research/out/other_*.json`: neighbour aggregates help trees on every graph tested).

**Causal account-history features.**
Every feature is computed from earlier payments only, before the current one updates the state. This is what lets the
same code run live and in research, and it rules out leakage from the future.

**Libraries.**

| Library | Used for | Why this one |
|---|---|---|
| axum + tokio | HTTP server | the standard async Rust web stack; small, fast, well maintained |
| serde / serde_json | JSON in and out, model files | the Rust standard for serialization |
| own XGBoost and LightGBM readers (`crates/rusetect/src/models`) | inference | no C library to link, exact control of float order for parity, TreeSHAP included |
| flate2, csv | streaming large datasets | stream gzip and CSV without loading files into memory |
| redis | scale-out path | shared account state across workers |
| vercel_runtime | serverless demo | the official Rust runtime for Vercel |
| XGBoost, LightGBM (Python) | training | best accuracy on tabular data; native missing-value handling |
| scikit-learn | isotonic calibration, metrics | reference implementations of PR-AUC, ROC-AUC, isotonic regression |
| pandas, numpy | research data handling | chunked CSV reading for files larger than memory |
| Playwright (Node) | PDF of the research page | prints the exact generated HTML page |

## Evaluation rules

- **Chronological splits.** Fraud changes over time; a random split lets the model see the future. Every dataset is
  split by time (60% train, 20% validation, 20% test).
- **Thresholds and calibration on validation only.** The test part is read once, after the decision.
- **Pre-registered adoption rules.** Each candidate model has its rule written in the script docstring before any test
  number exists. Two candidates were rejected by their own rules (format-free retrain, new indicators); that is the
  rule working, not a failure.
- **PR-AUC first.** With 0.1% positives ROC-AUC looks good for weak models; PR-AUC shows precision where it matters.
  ROC-AUC is used across datasets because prevalence differs 10 to 100 times between them.
- **No MAE, RMSE or R².** Those measure errors when predicting a number. Fraud is a yes/no outcome, so the metrics are
  ranking (PR-AUC, ROC-AUC), band precision and recall, and calibration (expected calibration error).

## Session decisions

**1. Require `payment_format`; reject unknown formats and currencies.**
The API used to fill a missing format with ACH, the format most laundering uses in the training data, which pushed
genuine payments into higher bands (`research/out/slice_results.json`, section F). Rejecting is safer than guessing.

**2. Fail closed on configuration.**
Demo keys used to switch on whenever no keys were configured, so a mis-deployed server would accept published keys. Now
the server refuses to start unless it is given real keys and secrets, or `RUSETECT_DEMO=1` explicitly.

**3. Cap in-memory account state.**
Random account ids could grow memory without limit. A cap (default 2,000,000 accounts) refuses only payments that would
add accounts; known accounts keep scoring.

**4. Hardened risk: a format-free second opinion.**
Laundering re-sent in another format dropped the cascade's PR-AUC from 0.71 to under 0.01, because 92% of training
laundering is ACH. Retraining without the format feature lost accuracy and was rejected by its rule. Taking the larger
of the two calibrated scores keeps the cascade's accuracy on honest traffic and the format-free model's robustness under
attack. It passed its rule (`research/out/hardened_eval.json`). Calibration (isotonic) is needed first, because the two
models' raw scores are on different scales; isotonic was chosen over Platt because it does not assume a shape.

**5. Pair aggregation before calibration.**
Splitting one payment into four defeats per-payment scoring. A 24 hour noisy-OR of the cascade risks of each payer to
payee pair restores part of the recall without fitted parameters. Aggregating after calibration barely helped (the
calibration map sends small risks to near zero), so the served version aggregates before calibration. That choice was
made after seeing the first result on the same window, and the report labels it exploratory
(`research/out/structuring_defence.json`).

**6. Compute explanations only for flagged payments.**
TreeSHAP was about 90% of scoring time and ran for payments that were approved anyway. Reasons are now computed only when
a payment leaves the safe band, from the model that actually set the risk.

**7. Stream and sample inside Rust.**
The IBM Large files have 180 million payments. Sampling genuine rows inside the Rust harness (state still updated for
every payment) made the dump about 8 times faster and kept the output small; totals are written next to each file so
every metric is reweighted to the true prevalence.

**8. Pooled second opinion: adopted.**
The format-free model was trained on HI-Small only and transfers poorly. A model pooled over every payment dataset
(bank AML, cards, wallets, and IEEE-CIS with real fraud labels) replaced it after passing all three of its rules (G1 to G3),
decided on validation parts only (`research/out/pooled_hardening.json`). The served engine was rebuilt and replayed
against the Python results; block decisions match exactly.

**8a. Payer window: not adopted.**
Widening the 24 hour window from a payer-payee pair to all of a payer's payments catches parts sent to new mule accounts,
but even with its own validation-fitted thresholds it raised clean block alerts about a hundredfold and failed rules A1
and A3 (`research/out/account_aggregation.json`). The pair window stays. The Python window was also rewritten to a
running log sum (linear time); it matches the old version to 1e-12.

**8b. Real against synthetic card data: real only.**
On IEEE-CIS (real card fraud) the arm trained on real data won on validation, and on test the synthetic-only arm was
close to random on the real data (`research/out/real_vs_synthetic.json`). Synthetic card sets are kept as tests, not as
a substitute for real training data. The unseen-payer subset is too small to support any claim.

**9. What was not done, and why.**
- No GNN: no evidence it beats trees with graph features here, and it would complicate serving and explanations.
- New indicators not served: they did not pass their pre-registered rule (`research/out/unified_train.json`).
- No claim of real-world accuracy: every payment model is trained on synthetic data; the shadow pilot
  (`docs/PILOT.md`) is the way to measure it on a bank's data.
